# Haskell MOOC Solutions

(Partial for now) solutions to the excellent [Haskell MOOC](https://haskell.mooc.fi/part1#exercises) created by Joel Kaasinen (Nitor) and John LÃ¥ng (University of Helsinki). The course includes automated tests for each exercise, allowing you to easily verify correctness.

## Note on Use of LLMs

No large language models (LLMs) were used to solve these exercises. The goal was to learn Haskell through independent problem-solving.
