# Haskell MOOC Solutions

(Partial for now) solutions to the excellent [Haskell MOOC](https://haskell.mooc.fi/part1#exercises) created by Joel Kaasinen (Nitor) and John LÃ¥ng (University of Helsinki). The course includes automated tests for each exercise, allowing you to easily verify correctness.You may find their original code also [here](https://github.com/moocfi/haskell-mooc).


## How to run the exercises
The easiest way is to use the Haskell tool [stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/). Navigate to the 'exercise' directory and run:

```shell
$ stack build
# replace <Number> with the exercise you want to check
$ run Set<Number>Test.hs
```

## Note on Use of LLMs

No large language models (LLMs) were used to solve these exercises. The goal was to learn Haskell through independent problem-solving.
